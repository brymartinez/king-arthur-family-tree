# Introduction

This is a DSA problem, and it requires DSA knowledge (commonly taught in CS courses).

If you are not familiar with data structures and algorithms, you can refer to the repository [here](https://github.com/brymartinez/data-structures-and-algorithms).

If you prefer to check out the linear data structure solution which is more memory-intensive, you can refer to the repository [here](https://github.com/brymartinez/family-tree).

# Problem
Our problem is set on the planet of Lengaburu, the distant galaxy of Tara B. Our protagonists are King Arthur, Queen Margaret and their family.

King Arthur is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 
years (they have long lives in Lengaburu!). Let’s write some code to get to know the family.

The solution should model out the King Arthur family tree so that:
- You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother
- Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in which they are added to the family tree

Simple right? Remember, our evaluation is based not only on getting the right output, but on how you come up with the solution altogether.
